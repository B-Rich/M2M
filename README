Projects you need:
	Put these on your python path:
		basic
		Markdown
		tagging

	You need django, obviously
	Also djangosphinx, but only because it has the API we want.

	You will also need nginx and apache2, unless you are doing development,
    in which case the bundled django server does just fine.
		config files should be in the repo; if they're not:
			well, fuck. you're screwed.
		nginx handles static media
		apache does the python shit.
